  <h1>The Basics of the Web & HTML</h1>  
  <h3><u>Overview</u></h3>
  <p>The <b>World Wide Web</b> is a collection of billions of web pages that can
  be accessed through the internet.  Web pages are documents 
  written in Hyper Text Markup Language (HTML) that are stored on 
  servers - which are just computers that are specially designed for hosting 
  web pages.  
  </br></br>
  To access a web page a person will need a computer with a 
  web browser and a connection to the internet.   
  The web browser will make a request through the internet to a 
  server by using Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP).  The server will 
  send the file to the user's computer, and the web browser will interpret
  the HTML and display the web page.</p>
  <h3><u>HTML</u></h3>
  <p>
  An <b>HTML</b> document will provide the structure and content of a web page by using
  different <b>elements</b>.  Elements are made up of <b>tags, content, and 
  attributes.</b>  Most elements will normally have a start tag and an
  end tag, which will define the element type.  In between the tags will be the 
  text content that will be displayed on the web page.  Elements can also contain 
  attributes, which contain additional information about the element. 
  </br></br>
  Some elements do not have any content, so
  rather than having a start and closing tag there is just a single tag.  
  These are called <b>void tags.  </b>One 
  example of a void tag is for a line break. 
  </br></br>
  Also, some types of tags 
  are considered <b>container tags</b>.  There are two sub-types of container tags: 
  <b>inline tags</b>, which refer to a specific segment of text content, and 
  <b>block tags</b>, which are like an invisible box around a block of content.
  </br></br>
  There are many different types of elements, so rather than memorizing them all
  it is best to understand how they work, and then if you need a new
  element you can search the internet.
